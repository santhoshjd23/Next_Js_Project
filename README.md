# Next_Js_Form
Just a POC to explore next.js with prisma ORM

Changes:
1. Created one basic form page which is having firstName and lastName as input fields.
2. While submitting the form, I am storing the data in sql db and alerting the user as "data stored".
3. After storing the data user is taken to another page which shows the created user (latestly created recored) and all the user details present in the DB.

Techs learned:
1. Forms handling
2. React.js
3. Next.js
4. MySql
5. Prisma ORM
